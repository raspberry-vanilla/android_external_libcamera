 * To select the correct value to use as ExposureTime value, applications
 * should accommodate the natural delay in applying controls caused by the
 * capture pipeline frame depth.

 * immediately specify an ExposureTime value in the same request where
 * ExposureTimeMode is set to Manual. They should instead wait for the
 * first Request where ExposureTimeMode is reported as
 * ExposureTimeModeManual in the Request metadata, and use the reported
 * ExposureTime to populate the control value in the next Request to be
 * queued to the Camera.
 *
 * The implementation of the auto-exposure algorithm should equally try to
 * minimize flickering and when transitioning from manual exposure mode to
 * auto exposure use the last value provided by the application as starting
 * point.
 *
 * 1. Start with ExposureTimeMode set to Auto
 *
 * 2. Set ExposureTimeMode to Manual

 * \brief The AF algorithm is in continuous mode.
 *
 * In this mode the lens can re-start a scan spontaneously at any
 * moment, without any user intervention. The AfState still reports
 * whether the algorithm is currently scanning or not, though the
 * application has no ability to initiate or cancel scans, nor to move
 * the lens for itself.
 *
 * However, applications can pause the AF algorithm from continuously
 * scanning by using the AfPause control. This allows video or still
 * images to be captured whilst guaranteeing that the focus is fixed.
 *
 * When set to AfModeContinuous, the system will immediately initiate a
 * scan so AfState will report AfStateScanning, and will settle on one
 * of AfStateFocused or AfStateFailed, depending on the scan result.

 * synchronised the client believes it is with the server.
